# Arithmetic Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Comparison Operators
# Logical Operators
# Identity Operators
# Membership Operators
# Bitwise Operators

# Assignment Operators
name = "Harini"
# '=' is an assignment operator
# Assign value from right side operands to left side operand
age = 25
# Comparison Operators
# Compare values and return boolean values
print(age == 25)
print(age > 18)
v1 = (1 == True)
print(v1)
print(type(v1))
v2 = (0 == False)
print(v2)
print(type(v2))
# Unary Operators
Age = +30
print(Age)
Num = -1
print(Num)
r = Age - Num
print(r)
s = Age + Num
print(s)
# Not Operator
is_adult = True
print(not is_adult)

# Is operator is identity operator and always returns boolean
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a is b)
print(a == b)

x = 5
y = 3
print(x is y)
print(x == y)
