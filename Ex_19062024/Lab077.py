# Important question
# Lambda Expression is used to do the task in one line instead of multiple line code

# def double_my_salary(salary):
#     return salary * 2
#
#
# new_salary = double_my_salary(28000)
# print(new_salary)


f_double_salary = lambda salary: salary * 2
print(f_double_salary(28000))
